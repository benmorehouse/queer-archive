# A Queer Online Archive, written in React and NextJS 


### What is this?  

Archives are very important in LGBTQ+ Studies (my major at USC). We use them on a daily basis to understand past and present and how society changes over time and how this impacts the queer community. 
A lot of dialogue today occurs on social medias, but we don't have an easy way for this to be harnessed and held for long term use. 

This website serves as a place for anyone to submit anything that they wish to have stored long term in the archive.
